This is a visualization based on on the monoscope plugin from
gstreamer.

Display is split in half horizontally. On upper part a real-time
oscilloscope is drawn. On lower part a voiceprint is drawn.

Voiceprint is a time-varying spectral representation (forming an image)
that shows how the spectral density of a signal varies with time.

Display size can be changed. All positions are calculated. This
visualization is heavy, it needs 80% of CPU of 2.60 GHz (1 core)
at 1600 x 900 pixels.
